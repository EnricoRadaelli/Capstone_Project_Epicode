This folder contains intermediate xlsx files that have been processed using Jupyter Notebook as part of the data preparation phase in the capstone project. 
The data herein reflects initial cleansing and structuring efforts but has not yet reached the final stage of cleanliness required for advanced analytics in Power BI.
The files in this folder serve as a transitional dataset used for further refinement and analysis in Power BI. 
They provide a snapshot of the data at an intermediary stage, useful for troubleshooting, audits, and understanding the evolution of data throughout the ETL process.

These files are intended for use within the context of this capstone project and are not yet suitable for final analysis. 
Further cleaning and transformation are expected to be conducted in Power BI before moving on to the data visualization and reporting phase.

Note
Please consider that the data may still contain inconsistencies or issues that will be addressed in subsequent stages of the project.
