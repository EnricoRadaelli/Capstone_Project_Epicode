# Capstone Project: Data Analysis with Python and Power BI

**Project Overview**

Hello, I am Enrico Radaelli, and this repository contains my capstone project completed as part of the Data Analyst certification at Epicode School. This project is an in-depth analysis of a simulated bicycle manufacturing company's data from Kaggle, utilizing Python and Power BI to extract, transform, and load the data for insightful business analytics.
A project presentation video is also included to offer a comprehensive overview of the methodologies and findings.

**Data and Tools**

The dataset includes various CSV files detailing business partners, employees, and store orders, among other aspects of the business.

**Tools**
- Python (Jupyter Notebook): Used for initial data selection, cleaning, and normalization;
- Power BI: Employed for advanced data transformations via Power Query, creating relationships with the star schema principle, and developing interactive visual dashboards.
- 
**Project Structure**
  
1. ETL Process:

- Initial data cleaning and selection were performed in Jupyter Notebook;
- Data transformation, including merging queries and column selection, was completed in Power BI's Power Query.

2. Analysis and Visualization:

- Main Dashboard: Key metrics displayed include monthly detailed profits by organization and state, with filters available for year, organization, and state;
- Current Year Analysis: Comparative insights with the previous year to gauge business growth and regional performance;
- Organizational Performance: Detailed views on the performance of organizations, individual stores, and employees;
- Geographical Profits: A map visualization showing profits by city, filterable by year, store, or organization;
- Hidden Orders Summary: A drill-through page summarizing all orders, accessible from other pages.

**Purpose and Insights**

The project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the company's operations, highlighting areas of success and potential improvement. The visualizations are designed to be interactively explored, offering stakeholders a deep dive into the data as per their interest.
