# Capstone_Project_Epicode
This repository hosts my capstone project for the Data Analyst course at Epicode School. The project showcases advanced data analysis using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Power BI on a dataset sourced from Kaggle. It demonstrates extensive ETL processes, data normalization, and insightful visual analytics in a structured business context.
